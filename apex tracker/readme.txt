This program is still very much experimental, but it currently works for mapping movement data throughout your games. First, you must enable coordinates in steam launch options. Add "cl_showpos 2" to your launch options. Now your in game coordinates will appear in the top left corner. When you start a game, run the coordinateTracker.py tool, and play your game as normal. When your game is over, close the script, and run the mappingTool.py This will then draw your game on a map, allowing you to record your movement.
